The predominant driving force pushing me to learn data science is an endless curiosity. In even the most mundane 
parts of life, I find something of interest that points to a bigger picture in the world around us. Data science gives us the 
opportunity to see out of the dark and into a world to which we were previously blind. Connecting data and drawing on 
it, allows us to make decisions and learn things that may not have been the obvious takeaway at first glance, with the 
naked eye. On top of that, the needs and uses for data science are countless. From a business's advertising 
investment, to an urban farming project, all the way down to making decisions on a personal level, as to how I should 
spend my time in any given day. Data science can be used to make decisions and predictions for almost anything in the 
world around us. It gives us a sense of power and the ability to be a positive influence on the world.


I have a lot of interests in all sorts of things. Music, crafts, science and mechanics, the list goes on. I enjoy learning 
everything I can about those things. Learning about other people's interests, and finding out why and what makes them 
interesting, is an eye opening and informative experience as well. Ive found that, the more I learn about anything, even 
if it seems to be of complete insignificance, the more I feel able to make better decisions regarding completely 
unrelated things in life. Drawing connections between different fields of study gives us the chance to make better 
decisions in whatever field we find ourselves. Data science gives us the opportunity to get to know anything in a deep 
sense, inside and out, while honing in on whatever element we decide to focus. It seems fair to say, that whatever 
project you are working on, you will get to know the ins and outs of that subject very well. And with data science we can 
start to see valuable connections which we could not see before.  This allows us to be more informed, make better 
choices, and to gain an upper hand over the competition, if that is so desired. That is a very satisfying and fulfilling 
feeling for me and a big reason why I am interested in data science. Diving into something and looking at data below 
the surface, allows us to know things that others simply could not know and see connections that otherwise would be 
unknown. This can have huge affects on the rest of the world as our understandings continue to grow.


From that previously unaccessed knowledge, comes power! With learning things in a new light, we have the ability to 
do something good for ourselves and other parts of the world. With power there is potential to go in any desired 
direction. The choice is there to be made, between what we determine  should be of importance and priority. Data 
science could be used to change the way we live, think, eat, grow food, harvest natural resources, run our 
governments, and develop technology to list  a few from an innumerable list of possible applications. Feeling the 
weight of that potential power and insight, encourages and inspires me to keep working, keep moving forward. It is 
exciting to feel the potential that I could have some type of influence on the world beyond just me and myself.  But to 
be able to contribute to the world heading in a direction that is more sustainable and inclusive of all people and other 
forms of life. Sure, I know that most jobs end up feeling mundane and thats part of life, but the potential is still a 
motivating factor and that will keep me interested and engaged in the processes of collecting data, organizing it, 
analyzing it, drawing conclusions and making predictions from that. For centuries, people talked to soothsayers or 
psychics to learn more about the things that were out of what was considered the earthly realm.  Those are no longer 
the times we live in, where a crystal ball is our best chance of foreseeing possible outcomes. Data science can give us 
a more reliable way of making predictions as to the direction things will go. and they can be very reliable predictions. It 
is a valuable role that can be part of any field.


Driven by curiosity and kept engaged by the many directions data science could take me, I am excited to keep learning 
about and to employ my skill set. Its nice to have an upper hand and be the keeper of the secret knowledge to which
data science gives us access. With that, we have power in the world to do a lot of different things. Data science gives 
us the ability to keep learning and applying what we learn. It is a positive and engaging field, which I am excited to 
explore. While the interest in continuing to learn through out a career excites me, I better not get ahead of myself. I have 
a lot to continue to learning about right now. My next blog post will be about something that I found challenging in this 
learning process and will focus on a technical aspect that I have researched and can explain..
